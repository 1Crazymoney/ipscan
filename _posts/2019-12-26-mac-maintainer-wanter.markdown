I am a Linux guy. While it is relatively easy for me to run a Windows VM for testing, it is much harder for Mac.

Moreover, Apple is making it increasingly difficult to release independent software for Mac, introducing the
*notarization* process.

As all of this requires owning a Mac computer (which I don't want for myself), I am looking for a contributor
to focus on Mac-specific issues, including [notarization](https://github.com/angryip/ipscan/issues/218), Dark theme support, 
dmg releases, etc.

Please let me know by [commenting here]((https://github.com/angryip/ipscan/issues/218)) if you are interested in helping Angry IP Scanner to be better supported on Mac. Thanks.
